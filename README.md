# Bug Hunting Notes Templates

> __These are not report templates__

## When you are starting out new
- It's hard to keep track and stay organized how much you tested a vulnerability and functionality of a program
- So I created these templates for manual hunting from my knowledge library.
- After doing my initial recon, I test the application for certain vulnerabilities I feel comfortable and fill these fields so that I have a certain goal like answering these questions/fields rather than passively  taking  notes on a single page that may work for some, but I thought this may be more engaging for me.
- __These templates are like checklists and recon based__

### Lemme elaborate this further
- After doing my initial recon, I choose a root domain and go through it's subdomains and if I find anything interesting I note it under it's respective root domain.
- Repeat the process for every root domain.
- After finding interesting subs and endpoints. I choose a target and break down it's functionalities, understand and __HUNT them!__
